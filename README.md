# Random-Wiki-Twitter-Bot
This is a twitterbot I made that grabs a random wikipedia article and sents it to the twitter api to post

To grab the url it uses: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Random then grabs the heading and joins it to the default wiki link

It might be pretty basic, but it was my first time creating a twitter bot and first time doing any webscraping so I'm proud. ðŸ˜€

You can find the bot in action [here](https://twitter.com/RngWiki)!

Hope you enjoy
